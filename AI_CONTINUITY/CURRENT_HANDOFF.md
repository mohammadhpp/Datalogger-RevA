# CURRENT HANDOFF — Datalogger RevA

## ACTIVE USER EXECUTION RULE — 2026-09-28, 23:40 Tehran

- User explicitly instructed: **«منتظر تأیید نباش؛ اینو در هندآف ثبت کن»**. Continue the Datalogger RevA power-block work autonomously through read-only investigation, calculations, source checks, design drafts, reversible documentation and necessary validation. Do not stop at each intermediate gate with “موافقی؟ / مرحله بعد؟”, do not repeatedly ask for limits already locked in the workbook, and do not impose another Windows PSpice→ZIP/upload cycle whose model has already proved invalid.
- User also instructed: **«S1 بعد پیدا می‌کنیم؛ ادامه بده»**. Defer exact S1 three-pole sourcing; preserve the user-approved three-pole functional architecture and the live four-pole CAD mismatch in T25BX/T25BY. Continue USB/OVP/handoff and other independent power analysis.
- Prepare a single concrete, reviewable consolidated power proposal, Iran-sourced exact new-part list, test criteria and one ECO/purchase decision when technically ready. User's instruction to continue removes routine confirmation pauses; it does **not** turn unverified simulations into PASS or authorize claiming fabricated hardware. Do not ask for routine permission to write continuity reports or investigate candidates. If an irreversible purchase/fabrication action or a material change of locked product requirements truly requires a user choice, complete all independent work first and present the specific decision once.
- Keep GitHub `main` authoritative, maintain one live CURRENT EXACT POINT, and carry these instructions across chats. Preserve T24 0/0 DRC as a CAD-only checkpoint and FABRICATION HOLD until power gates are actually closed.

## CURRENT EXACT POINT — T25CG timeout audited / model route blocked / architecture screen, 2026-10-06 UTC

- Read `AI_CONTINUITY/T25CG_T25CF_TIMEOUT_AND_REGULATED_MUX_SCREEN_FA.md`. T25CF ZIP SHA256543cb3e4d98385f1ee8c61ec4d686275888d8c5286d2c072b4ff407b2527bf1f: pilot CASE_TIMEOUT after240.1857475s, successful parsing/bias and transient announced, no PRINT rows/JOB CONCLUDED/DAT supplied. ORPSIM-16534 warns highITL4 may increase runtime; no new convergence error printed. Actual simulated end time is UNKNOWN. Six USB cases never launched. No hardware verdict.
- **TPS54202 bounded macro-model route BLOCKED; no further T25CE/T25CF rerun requested.** Timeout is not proof of a faulty model or physical IC. Preserve raw evidence; do not lengthen the timer or relax solver blindly.
- Independent source-grounded alternative screened: retain TPS631000/L1 as ready battery regulator, place TPS2116 after separate battery/USB regulated rails. Backup>=2.5V would address the datasheet's fast-collapse reset condition only if verified dynamically. This is an UNSELECTED architecture draft; standby battery regulator remains powered and has nonzero losses. Old3.576V USB fixture (static max3.712055V) cannot directly feed STM32G070 3.6V operating limit; new USB setpoint/PR1/Cbus/RCB/SD-drop/sourcing/layout require redesign screening.
- Executed18 capacitor-energy cases for this draft: illustrative3.135V start,19/280mA power envelopes,6.2us TI typical (not max),50/100us declared gaps and10.4/22/47uF effectiveC scenarios. At280mA, Cbus to2.7V is4.514uF at6.2us and72.807uF at100us, excludingESR/RCB/source/switch drop. No claim these capacitors/gaps represent the board. Script/raw CSV/JSON retained.
- TPS631000/Murata L1 and SD T25BK/BL preserved; exactS1 deferred; two USB branches/expansion5V protection, realCeff, startup atloaded1.80V and full no-reset remain OPEN. No CAD/ECO/purchase/DRC/fabrication change.

## Accepted design and validation baseline

- Live engineering source: private GitHub `mohammadhpp/Datalogger-RevA`, branch `main`, and the user's Windows repo `C:\#MHP FILES\DataLoger`. Historical ZIPs are rollback/evidence only. Read `AI_START_HERE.md` and its required source registry and continuation rules first.
- No RevA PCB has been fabricated. Existing final PCB-mounted parts were purchased; proposed new power parts are not an approved purchase. Canonical PCB `DATALOGER_RevA.PcbDoc`, library `Datalogger_RevA_Clean.PcbLib`.
- T23 routing CLOSED/PASS; T24 courtyards 129/129 persistent, last accepted Full Batch DRC 0 warnings / 0 violations at `3ea38daf1998dc926ec7ee77df95ce5ccf42d3b8`. No fresh DRC or functional PASS is claimed.
- Locked requirements: two-layer PCB; schematic grid 100 mil; readable PCB RefDes/polarity/pin-1; correct connectors for off-board devices; loaded pack minimum 1.80V; no USB nuisance cutoff at 5.50V; uninterrupted USB-priority battery↔USB transfers, zero MCU reset and no intentional AA backfeed.
- **19 mA** is the old prototype observation with unknown bandwidth; **280 mA** is the historical RevA maximum design envelope, not a measured peak. Keep both provenance labels. SD 400mA is a historic switch-drop sizing point, not a measured card peak.
- Retain TPS631000 and Murata `DFE322512F-1R0M=P2` 1µH L1. TPS54202DDCR and its separate USB coil remain exploratory, unselected; do not silently substitute them.
- S1 three-pole maintained functional architecture is user-approved: BAT, USB, and common return ends of the two separate CC Rd resistors. Live CAD still shows four contacts; see T25BX/T25BY. Exact switch procurement is deferred by user.
- Every new replacement part needs exact-MPN technical and practical Iranian availability evidence. Close the whole power block, present one consolidated purchase/ECO proposal, then obtain that single concrete design decision before modifying Altium. No partial order or power ECO.

## Evidence already completed; do not repeat

- T25BD/T25BE: 12/12 valid user PSpice capacitor-only cases independently match T25AZ. Conditional source/capacitor scenarios do not qualify physical RevA.
- T25BF/T25BG and T25BT/T25BV official encrypted TPS631000 short/precharged/SS=1 fixtures completed jobs but failed the regulated 3.3V pre-state gate. Post-step outputs are rejected. No hardware failure inferred; do not request another identical Windows run.
- T25AE TPS2116 vendor-model behavior conflicts with independent TI evidence. Do not repeat the discrepant fixture or interpret its output as hardware transfer PASS/FAIL.
- T25BH conditional slew targets are sensitivity results, not actual AO3401A gate timing.
- **SD controlled-inrush sub-gate is already screened**: T25BK independently audited 16 TPS22918 official-model cases; T25BL gives the unapplied ECO and exact Iranian sourcing. Do not reopen SD selection.
- SD candidate: `TPS22918DBVT`, CT `C1608NP01H472J080AA` 4.7nF C0G 0603, input bypass `C2012X7R1H105K125AB` 1µF X7R 0805, existing 100k ON pulldown. Correct physical pads 1 VIN, 2 GND, 3 ON, 4 CT, 5 QOD, 6 VOUT. Exact T25BL sourcing supersedes earlier provisional Samsung parts. This is a sub-gate technical/procurement screen, not an applied ECO or complete power purchase list.
- Actual card/module transients, TPS631000 source/startup at loaded 1.80V, exact biased Ceff, OVP and weak-battery no-reset handoff remain OPEN. No integrated system or fabrication PASS.
- Historical T25AI Altium netlist preparation does not establish an Altium execution. Newer T25CD and the active execution rule govern continuation; do not restart old compatibility loops merely from chat memory.

## Cleanup and preserved history

Exact pre-T25CG handoff archived in `AI_CONTINUITY/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_BEFORE_T25CG_2026-10-06.md` (source blob 540c0318277f1ee1070cc0a618534c0d1f03f28c).

Exact pre-T25CF live handoff archived in `AI_CONTINUITY/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_BEFORE_T25CF_2026-10-06.md` (source blob e8a342bcb91f580285ef7f27cdc1377668ddbb19).

Exact pre-T25CE live handoff is also archived in `AI_CONTINUITY/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_BEFORE_T25CE_2026-10-02.md` (source blob7416df90961a0981cfc3421791806ead75979d9f).

The exact pre-compaction live handoff is preserved byte-for-byte in
`AI_CONTINUITY/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_PRE_COMPACTION_2026-10-02.md`
(source blob `7374eeb3fe3b931a72e22d68cd9438fbbe0b294b`, baseline main `3a1c713a1e371546a2fa72116adc5fe235e5686c`).

Read archived details only when needed; the sole active continuation point is the T25CG section above. Further evidence and older checkpoints remain in `HISTORY.md`, dated T25 reports and source archives.

The 2026-09-28 cleanup audit is `GITHUB_CLEANUP_AUDIT_2026-09-28.md`: canonical SchLib was restored byte-identically; duplicate PcbLib and T23/T24 evidence retained pending dependency/path checks. Do not delete evidence to reduce apparent clutter. This compaction repairs documentation only.

**NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION:** AI continues the consolidated comparison: existing upstream mux versus two regulated inputs/downstream mux. Resolve USB setpoint/PR1 worst-case margin, backup-ready condition at1.80V, new Cbus versus converter C_OUT, reverse-blocking delay, SD rail drop and exact Iran BOM before one ECO/purchase decision. Do not request another unchanged vendor run, fabricate a board or silently apply this draft.

**BLOCKER REQUIRING USER:** None for the remaining independent architecture/sourcing review. Integrated functional evidence remains BLOCKED by unqualified macro-model execution/dynamics and real source/Ceff/card/module parameters; this is not resolved by more ZIP retries. A later bench/fabrication/purchase or material requirement decision needs one concrete reviewed proposal.

**FABRICATION HOLD.** Continuity CI validates file retention and metadata; it does not certify circuit function.
